                <span>
                    <b>Educate:</b> We strive to educate individuals and communities about the risks of hepatitis B and the benefits of vaccination

                <b class="why-header">Why Hepatitis B Vaccination Matters</b>

                <span>
                    Hepatitis B is a serious viral infection that can lead to liver damage, liver cancer, and even death if left untreated.
                    Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent hepatitis B transmission and its potentially life-threatening
                    consequences. By promoting vaccination, we aim to protect individuals and communities from the burden of hepatitis
                    B-related diseases.
